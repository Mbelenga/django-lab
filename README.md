# 🧪 Django Lab

Welcome to **Django Lab** – a personal space where I learn, experiment, and build with the Django web framework.

This repository contains a collection of small projects, code snippets, and practical exercises that help me deepen my understanding of Django. From simple apps to more advanced features, this is my sandbox for growth.

- 🧩 Scalable: Great for small projects and large-scale platforms.
- 🛡️ Secure: Comes with built-in security features.
- ⚙️ Pythonic: Written in Python, which I love!
